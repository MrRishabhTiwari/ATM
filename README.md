# ATM System with Python and Tkinter

This project implements a basic ATM System using Python programming language and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). It simulates typical ATM functionalities such as login, checking balance, transaction history, withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.

## Features

- **Login Authentication**: Secure login using user ID and PIN (default credentials: User ID - `1234`, PIN - `1234`).
- **Transaction History**: View history of transactions performed.
- **Withdraw**: Withdraw funds from the account with balance validation.
- **Deposit**: Deposit funds into the account.
- **Transfer**: Transfer funds to another account with balance validation.
- **Real-time Balance Updates**: Balance is updated and displayed after each transaction.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Implemented with Tkinter for a straightforward and intuitive user experience.


## Usage

- Upon running, the application window will display a login screen.
- Use the default credentials (`User ID: 1234`, `PIN: 1234`) to log in.
- Once logged in, you can perform transactions like checking balance, viewing transaction history, withdrawing, depositing, transferring funds, and quitting the application.
